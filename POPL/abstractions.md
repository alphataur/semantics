# Abstractions

> Abstraction is hiding things or information that is irrelevant to a given context, while holding on to the relevant bits.

Consider a calculator,

Calculator are equipped with super powers like calculating huge numbers incredibly fast.
We do know how to operate the calculator, even the instruction manual comes with the calculator which instructs how to perform operations. 

In order to calculate, we do know the buttons to press and we also know in what order to press them. What we dont know is how does the calculator do that internally.

The primary intention is to perform some calculations, we dont necessarily need to know
how a calculator does that. 

We say the calculator is abstracting away the details of how it calculate the numbers in turn it is providing a interface to calculate numbers with ease.


> The relationship of a programmer and a computer is the same as a snake charmer and snake.

We are surrounded by abstractions in real world let alone the digital one I am writing the notes in. The capitalistic society kinda maximizes it's benefit using this concept.  

## The programming model
We can often see computers as aliens which understand a different language other than our. If we want to tell
